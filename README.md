# Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they woud like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.  Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button.  When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
