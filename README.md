# Burger
Burgers! Burgers! Burgers! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to order.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- showing what has been ordered.  Each burger in the ordered area also has a Deliver it! button.  When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page therefore delivered.  The app stores every burger in the database, whether delivered or not.
